### Ideal Gas law solver program. 
# Pressure x Volume = moles x Ideal gas constant x Temperature

# Example Problem: What volume of CO2 is needed to fill an 0.5 moles tank to a pressure of 150.0 atm at 27.0 Celsius? 
# Example 2: If I have 4 moles of gas at a pressure of 5.6 atm and a volume of 12 Liters, what is the temperature?
# Example 3: At what temperature would 2.10 moles of N2 gas have a pressure of 1.25 atm and in a 25.0 L tank?
# Example 4: What volume is occupied by 5.03 moles of O2 at 28 째C and a pressure of 0.998 atm?
# Example 5: What volume is occupied by 5.03 grams of O2 at 28 째C and a pressure of 0.998 atm?
