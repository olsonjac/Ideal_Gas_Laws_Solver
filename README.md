# Ideal_Gas_Laws_Solver
This repository hosts the script that I wrote to solve word problems that are pasted into it. It is used specifically to solve ideal gas law problems that utilize the PV=nRT formula.

This script will take a text that is copied and pasted into the console and parse it out to find the correct values to assign to the corresponding variables from the formula listed above.

It is worth noting that the script currently requires that no punctuation be attached to the units (L, atm, etc...) in order for this to work properly. 
There may be functionality in the future that will strip out any extraneous punctuation to avoid this issue.
