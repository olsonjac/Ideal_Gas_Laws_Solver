# Ideal_Gas_Laws_Solver
This repository hosts the script that I wrote to solve word problems that are pasted into it. It is used specifically to solve ideal gas law problems that utilize the PV=nRT formula.

This script will take a text that is copied and pasted into the console and parse it out to find the correct values to assign to the corresponding variables from the formula listed above.

It will then solve for the missing variable.

## Running Tests
Install `pytest` and run the test suite from the repository root:

```bash
pytest
```
